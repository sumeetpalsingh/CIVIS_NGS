# Hands-on course on RNA-Seq Analysis

Course on analysis of NGS RNA-Seq data using online tools.

The course can be followed with zero prior knowledge of any bioinformatics tool or coding.

## Topics Covered
Analysis of RNA-Seq count data
   - Count Matrix
   - Normalization
   - Differential Gene Expression Analysis
   - Representation of DGE (Volcano Plot)
   - Functional Analysis (GO Terms)

The course requires only two tools:
1. Excel / LibreOffice
2. Active internet connection

The course utilizes the following online tools:
1. [iDEP](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/)
2. [VolcaNoseR](https://goedhart.shinyapps.io/VolcaNoseR/)

And we will attempt to analyze the data from [Arunachalam et al., *Science* 2020. DOI: 10.1126/science.abc6261](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6508/1210). The data is shared on [GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE152418).
