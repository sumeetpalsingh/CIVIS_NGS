# Hands-on course on RNA-Seq Analysis

Course on analysis of NGS RNA-Seq data using online tools.

The course can be followed with zero prior knowledge of any bioinformatics tool or coding.

## Topics Covered
1. Analysis of RNA-Seq count data
   - Count Matrix
   - Normalization
   - Differential Gene Expression Analysis
   - Representation of DGE (Volcano Plot)
   - Functional Analysis (GO Terms)
2. Hands-on mapping of RNA-Seq raw data (fastq file)
   - Different files used in genomics (fastq, sam / bam, genome index and gtf / gff3)
   - Galaxy for generating count data
   - Workflows in Galaxy

The course requires only two tools:
1. Excel / LibreOffice
2. Active internet connection

The course utilizes the following online tools:
1. [iDEP](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/idep/)
2. [VolcaNoseR](https://huygens.science.uva.nl/VolcaNoseR/)
3. [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.eu/)
